#Pluto Rover Documentation
- This is my attempt to solve the plum guide recruitment test based on the Pluto Rover.
- The solution is made up of a .NET 5 class library and a single unit test project using XUnit.
- The PlutoRover class implements the IGridService dependency which is mocked in the rover unit tests.
- The solution implements all the requirements of the test implementing all the commands: F/B and L/R.
- With grid wrapping and obstacle detection.
